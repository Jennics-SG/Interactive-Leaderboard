# Interactive-Leaderboard
 Leaderboard build in PixiJs, allows for populating with names, then you can add / remove points as necessary.


# How to run
 Make sure to build the most recent version of the code
 ```asgl
    npm run build
 ```

 To rebuild with every change made to src you can use `npm run watch`

 To run a PIXI application you have to have a web-server running, personally I cd into `dist/` after building and run use (http-server)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server]
 ```asgl
    http-server
 ```
